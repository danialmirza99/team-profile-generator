## Description

In this assignment, I created a HTML file from scratch. I ask the user to input details on a manager, then a select number or engineers and interns. I used inquirer to prompt the user to fill in the details, then collected the user inputs to display on the generated HTML file.

## Installation

Run the command "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" to install the inquirer. Then run "npm install" to acquire the node modules.

## Errors

1) I could not implement the classes correctly, so I left my expected method of using them in the form of comments
2) I could not add more engineers or interns, however, I was able to ask the user if they wanted to input more.
